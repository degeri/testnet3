Split Ticket Testing-Quikke
This is a test proposal to test split ticket ownership when it comes to Politeia proposals. The current consensus is that the user who contributes the most DCR to a split ticket session gets to cast the vote in Politeia for the split ticket.

I want to get an understanding of the process regarding split tickets from both Decrediton and the Politeia CLI so I can continue assisting users in all aspects of ticket splitting.

I'm also checking out the workings of submitting a proposal via Politeia from the perspective of a proposal author.

Participation in this proposal and the ticket splitting is welcome - if you're interested, you can use my testnet stakepool at testnet.decredvoting.com. If you are interested in ticket splitting on mainnet this is also a good opportunity to get familiar with the software. Ping me @David in Slack if you need help getting setup.
