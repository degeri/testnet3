## Politeia Digest #9 is here

This is a **special year end edition** in which I will present some stats and graphs about Politeia activity for (the last two months of) 2018.

### New proposals

**[Baeond: The Futurefunk Autonomous Card Game](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/f545b359fcf1b40b356e9cb556cb422cc7ff01b628b577f804cdc45ce414f5dd)**

This proposal is about a Futurepunk Autonomous Card Game that would fork Decred and use it as a foundation for the game. The attraction of using Decred seems to be ticket-based governance and the prospective DEX. In exchange for 13,000 DCR (about $220k) Decred would become a technology partner for the game, and Playproof LLC would "staff one engineer exclusively with maintaining $DCR changes from upstream". The proposal initially asked for a lump-sum payment up front, it has been edited, in response to community feedback, to amend this to monthly payments over a 7.5 month period.

This proposal is about a paid partnership with Smart Reach involving sponsorship of a podcast and conference calls about governance proposals. This proposal was followed up by a [pre-proposal on reddi that got edited](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/a9o1wj/preproposal_smart_reach_partnership_proposal_jan/) on Dec 26, while it was awaiting admin review on Politeia. member for 2 years and a Dash MNO before that. Although the proposal did not include any specific budget, @cryptosi mentioned ballpark figures of 50-100 DCR per cycle/month in a [reddit comment](https://www.editedurl.com).
